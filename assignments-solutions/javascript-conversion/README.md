# Learning Testing: Temperature Converter

1. Clone this repository.
1. Open the testing file called temperature.spec.js in VisualStudio Code.
1. Add tests to temperature.spec.js to test the functionality in the temperature.js module.
1. Run your tests and make sure that they fail using `mocha temperature.spec.js`.
1. Open temperature.js in VisualStudio Code.
1. Write a function called fahrenheitToCelsius(degreesFahrenheit) that converts a temperature in Fahrenheit to Celsius and returns the temperature in Celsius.
1. Write a function called celsiusToFahrenheit(degreesCelsius) that converts a temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit and returns the temperature in Fahrenheit.
1. Export both functions in your temperature.js module.
1. Run your tests and update your code until all of your tests pass.
1. Stage, commit, and push your changes to your repository.

You will need to research how to mathematically convert from one temperature to another.
